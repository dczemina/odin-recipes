        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Return to your childhood with this timeless recipe. Bring back the days of waking up an eating a fresh bowl of cereal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cereal</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose the cereal that you want to eat. This is likely the most difficult step of the journey.</li>
            <li>Carefully open the box so as not to tear the tab that you will use to close the box later on. Nothing is more frustrating than stale cereal.</li>
            <li>Open the bag without spilling any of the precious cereal on the floor.</li>
            <li>Pour the cereal into your bowl.</li>
            <li>Douse the cereal with your chosen milk. Add a little extra if you want to have extra at the end.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
