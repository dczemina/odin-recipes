# Odin Recipes

## Description
This project was created while following along with [this lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) on The Odin Project.

## Goals
As an experienced developer, I was already familiar with the contents of this lesson. However, I wanted to brush up on my web development skills since I have been primarily a java and plsql developer for the last 5 years. This is a fun way to brush up on those skills while having some fun.
